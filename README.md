- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lorenzo.francos
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in animation and technology
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript with the intention of understanding how web apps work and be able to create interesting projects
- ðŸ“« How to reach me lorfran14@hotmail.com

If you want to see my journey you can take a look at my frontend Mentor [Profile](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Lfrancos/solutions).
Here it will be much easier to see my practice. 

All of the exercises up until "advanced" are going to be done with vanilla JavaScript. I want to understand what I'm doing with JavaScript before I jump into a framework (has been a really hard decision to pick one :( )



This is by no means my portfolio this is just the practice projects that I've been doing so that eventually, I can create a portfolio.

Hope you like it : )
