If you want to see my journey you can take a look at my forntend Mentor [Profile](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Lfrancos/solutions). Here it will be much easier to see my practice. 
This is by no means my portfolio this is just the practice proyects that I've been doing so that eventually I can create a portfolio.

Hope you like it : )
